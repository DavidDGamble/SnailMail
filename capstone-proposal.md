# Capstone Proposal

## Name of Student:
_David Gamble_

## Name of Project:
_Snail Mail_

## Project's Purpose or Goal: 
_Users will be able to upload photos, create custom postcards, and use a third party api to print and send the postcard to their friends and family._

## List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
_For the absolute minimum features I would like the user to be able to upload a photo and create a postcard.  No third party api for printing and shipping._

## What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
* _C#_
* _.NET 6_
* _ASP.NET Core MVC 6_

## If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
_The final goal, if I can complete the mvp, will be to hook up the api so the user can actually print and send out a postcard.  If there is more time after that then I would also like to add the ability to create accounts, log in/out, and store user's info and previous postcard creations._

## What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
* _Entity Framework Core_
* _MySQL_
* _API unknown at the moment_

## Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
_You are awesome Patrick and hopefully you can use this to send someone a postcard when I finish._ ðŸ˜„
